/**
 * Walks the audit log re-deriving every hash, and reports the first divergence.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a runnable check
 *
 * `verifyChain` is a property of the domain model, and a property nobody can
 * invoke is not a security control. Tamper-evidence only bites when someone
 * actually looks — an operator, an auditor, or a scheduled job re-hashing the
 * log and comparing. This use case is that action, and
 * `infrastructure/cli/verify-chain.ts` is its operator-facing form.
 *
 * Detection, not prevention. The append-only constraints mean Verixa itself
 * cannot edit these rows, but nothing here stops an attacker holding database
 * credentials, and no check can. What this produces is proof that they did.
 *
 * ## Why the walk is batched, and outside any transaction
 *
 * Hashing a million entries is CPU work. Doing it with a transaction open — or
 * a pooled connection parked on it — turns a verification into an outage for
 * everything else sharing that database. Each batch is one independent read, so
 * the connection returns to the pool between them and a verification running
 * alongside live traffic is just another reader. Expensive work stays outside
 * transaction boundaries, as every use case here requires.
 *
 * The consequence is that a verification is a snapshot taken over time: the
 * chain may grow while it runs, which is harmless, since new entries link to
 * the old head and cannot invalidate what was already checked.
 *
 * ## Organization scoping, and the alternative that was rejected
 *
 * There is one chain and `organizationId` is a field inside it, so filtering to
 * one tenant's entries and re-deriving hashes over that filtered list reports a
 * break on every entry after the first — a subsequence of a chain is not a
 * chain, because each entry commits to its *global* predecessor. Per-organization
 * chains would need a per-organization `sequence`, and `sequence` is globally
 * unique precisely because that is what makes a forked append impossible.
 *
 * So an organization-scoped run verifies the entire range and reports which
 * entries inside it belong to the tenant. That answers the question an operator
 * actually has — "are this organization's records, and the links running
 * through everyone else's records between them, intact?" — at the same cost as
 * an unscoped run.
 *
 * ## Anchored ranges
 *
 * When `checkAnchors` is set, each receipt is checked two ways, and the two
 * answers mean different things:
 * - `matchesDatabaseChain` — the hash this database recomputes at that sequence
 *   equals the hash the receipt claims was anchored. Fails when the local log
 *   was rewritten after anchoring.
 * - `matchesLedger` — the public ledger really holds that hash under that
 *   reference, which is independent of Verixa entirely: it is what an auditor
 *   with no access to our systems would find.
 *
 * Ledger matches but database mismatch is the tampering signal. Database
 * matches but ledger mismatch means the receipt is fabricated.
