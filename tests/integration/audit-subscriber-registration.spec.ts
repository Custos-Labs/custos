/**
 * Audit subscribers are attached during composition (Issue 135).
 *
 * Two things are being proved here, and neither can be proved by a unit test
 * of a subscriber:
 *
 * 1. **Every subscriber is registered.** A subscriber that exists, is fully
 *    tested inside its own package, and is never wired up records nothing. It
 *    fails as a missing row months later, not as a red test. Each event name
 *    below is asserted against a composed container: the row that is not
 *    registered is the test that fails.
 * 2. **Registration happens before anything can publish.** These tests publish
 *    on a container that never had `buildApp` called on it. If registration
 *    were deferred to app construction — the tempting lazy version — the
 *    publisher would accept the subscription after the first event had already
 *    been dropped, and nothing here would notice. The first event a process
 *    publishes is the one a late registration loses.
 *
 * The login test covers the other direction: the route's own audit writes reach
 * Postgres and chain correctly, so the log a verification run reads is the log
 * the HTTP layer produced.
