 * `UserRepository`; it has no idea one is backed by Prisma. That's what makes
 * the whole application layer testable without a database — and it only holds
 * because the knowledge of "which implementation" is concentrated here rather
 * than scattered across the modules that use them.
 *
 * The rule to preserve: **nothing outside this file imports a `Prisma*`
 * class.** The moment a route handler constructs its own repository, the
 * dependency inversion is gone and that handler can no longer be tested
 * without a database. Wiring is deliberately boring and explicit for the same
 * reason — a DI container would hide these edges behind runtime resolution,
 * where a missing dependency becomes a runtime failure instead of a compile
 * error. At this size, explicit construction costs a few lines and buys
 * complete type safety.

 * (`DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`, `DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) instead of
 * requiring operators to hand-append query parameters to a URL and get the
 * spelling right.
