# Comprehensive Credential Flows Implementation

## Summary

This PR consolidates four interconnected issues around credential management, establishing a complete foundation for secure authentication flows. It encompasses threat modeling, API boundary enforcement, test coverage patterns, and educational documentation.

## Closes

- Closes #077: Threat model for credential flows (STRIDE-based)
- Closes #078: packages/credentials public API surface
- Closes #080: Credential flows educational walkthrough
- Closes #076: Coverage-gate pattern for packages/credentials (Phase 02)

## Changes

### 1. Threat Model Documentation (#077)

**Branch:** `docs/threat-model-credentials`

- Added comprehensive STRIDE-based threat model for credential flows
- Documented threat scenarios including:
  - Credential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks
  - Unauthorized access and privilege escalation
  - Credential storage vulnerabilities
  - Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Identified mitigation strategies for each threat category
- Established security considerations for credential lifecycle management

**Files:**

- `docs/security/threat-model-credentials.md`

### 2. Public API Surface and Boundary Enforcement (#078)

**Branch:** `feat/credentials-api-boundary`

- Curated public API surface for `packages/credentials`
- Enforced clear module boundaries to prevent internal implementation leakage
- Established export restrictions for internal-only utilities
- Created explicit public interface contracts
- Improved type safety through proper encapsulation

**Files:**

- `packages/credentials/src/index.ts` (refined exports)
- Updated package boundaries and barrel files
- Documentation of public API contract

### 3. Coverage-Gate Pattern (#076)

**Branch:** `feature/076-credentials-coverage-gate`

- Applied Phase 02 coverage-gate pattern to `packages/credentials`
- Established test coverage thresholds and enforcement
- Integrated coverage gates into CI/CD pipeline
- Ensured maintainable test coverage standards across the credentials package
- Configured coverage reporting and validation

**Files:**

- `packages/credentials/vitest.config.ts`
- Coverage configuration and thresholds
- CI workflow updates for coverage validation

### 4. Educational Walkthrough (#080)

**Branch:** `docs/secure-auth-tutorial`

- Created comprehensive "Build Secure Authentication" tutorial
- Step-by-step guide through credential flow implementation
- Best practices and security considerations explained
- Real-world examples and code samples
- Integration with threat model and API boundary documentation

**Files:**

- `docs/guides/tutorials/build-secure-authentication.md`
- Example implementations demonstrating secure patterns
- Links to threat model and security documentation

## Architecture & Design

This PR establishes the credentials package as a secure, well-documented, and properly tested foundation:

```
packages/credentials/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts (public API surface)
│   ├── flows/ (internal implementations)
│   ├── types/ (public-facing types)
│   └── ... (internal utilities)
├── tests/ (comprehensive coverage)
└── vitest.config.ts (coverage-gate pattern)
```

## Security Considerations

- All changes follow the threat model documented in this PR
- Public API surface is minimized to reduce attack surface
- Internal implementations are properly encapsulated
- Test coverage ensures security-critical paths are validated
- Documentation provides clear guidance on secure usage patterns

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- New test coverage meets Phase 02 standards (target: 85%+ coverage)
- Coverage gates are enforced in CI
- Educational examples include test scenarios

## Documentation

- Threat model provides security context for future development
- Public API documentation establishes clear contracts
- Tutorial guides developers through proper implementation
- All changes align with existing project documentation standards

## Breaking Changes

None. This PR introduces no breaking changes to existing APIs or functionality.
